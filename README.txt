Pin your preferred AI model per capability, control the HTTP request timeout, and log every AI generation call — all from one settings page.

== Description ==

AcrossAI Model Manager gives site administrators full control over three aspects of the WordPress 7.0 AI client: which model is used per capability, how long requests are allowed to run, and a complete audit log of every AI generation call made on the site.

**Model Preferences**

By default, WordPress picks the first available model from your configured AI connectors. This plugin adds a settings page under **Settings > AcrossAI Model Manager** where you can pin a specific model per capability — and that model will always be prioritised.

* **Text Generation** — preferred model for all text-generation tasks
* **Image Generation** — preferred model for image-generation tasks
* **Vision / Multimodal** — preferred model for vision and multimodal tasks

**HTTP Request Timeout**

Set a site-wide timeout (in seconds) for all `wp_ai_client_prompt()` calls. Works directly with the WordPress 7.0 built-in AI client — no additional plugins required.

**AI Request Logging**

Every successful AI generation call is automatically logged to a dedicated database table. The **Settings > AI Logs** admin page provides a sortable, paginated view of all requests with:

* Provider, model, and capability for each call
* Full prompt text and response text (expandable detail view)
* Token usage (prompt, completion, total) and request duration
* **Source tracking** — which plugin, theme, mu-plugin, or WordPress core file triggered the request, including the file path and line number
* Configurable log retention (auto-delete logs older than N days via WP-Cron)

Settings are stored as a single serialised option and exposed to the WordPress REST API, so the settings page saves without a full page reload using a React-powered interface.

**Requirements:**

* WordPress 7.0 or higher.
* The [AI plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ai/) must be installed and activated for **Model Preferences** to work. Without it, the Model Preferences dropdowns are disabled and no models will appear. The HTTP Request Timeout and AI Logging features work with WordPress 7.0 core directly.
* At least one AI connector (e.g. Llama.cpp, Hugging Face, OpenAI via the AI Connectors screen) must be configured for Model Preferences to work.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `acrossai-model-manager` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install through the WordPress Plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **Settings > AcrossAI Model Manager**.
4. Choose your preferred model for each capability type from the dropdowns. Only models from configured and connected providers appear.
5. Click **Save Changes**.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need any other plugins for this to work? =

It depends on what you want to use.

* **Model Preferences (choosing a preferred model per capability):** Yes — the [AI plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ai/) must be installed and activated, and at least one AI provider must be configured via the Connectors screen (**Settings > Connectors**). If the AI plugin is not active, the Model Preferences dropdowns are automatically disabled on the settings page.
* **HTTP Request Timeout:** No additional plugin required. The timeout setting works with the WordPress 7.0 built-in AI client directly and takes effect for all AI calls on your site.

= Does this work with the WordPress 7.0 built-in WP AI Client? =

Not fully yet. The WordPress AI client (introduced in WordPress 7.0) does not currently expose a filter that allows plugins to override the model being used. Model Preferences therefore requires the separate [AI plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ai/) which provides the `wpai_preferred_*_models` filter hooks this plugin relies on.

The **HTTP Request Timeout** setting does work directly with the WP AI Client via the `wp_ai_client_default_request_timeout` filter.

Full WP AI Client support for Model Preferences is planned for a future release once WordPress core adds the necessary hooks.

= What happens if my preferred provider loses its API key or connection? =

The plugin checks whether the provider is currently connected before applying the preference. If the provider is disconnected, WordPress falls back to its default model selection — your preference is preserved in the database and will take effect again once the provider is reconnected.

= Where is the preference stored? =

Preferences are stored in the WordPress options table under the key `acai_model_manager_preferences` as a JSON object with one entry per capability type (e.g. `{"text_generation":"openai::gpt-4o"}`).

= Can I set different models for different capability types? =

Yes. Text generation, image generation, and vision can each have their own preferred model independently.

= Will this work with custom or third-party AI providers? =

Any provider registered with the [AI plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ai/) that exposes its models through the standard metadata API will appear automatically in the dropdowns — no additional configuration is needed in this plugin.

== Changelog ==

= 0.0.7 =
* Fix admin hook name from `settings_page_` to `toplevel_page_` — resolves missing styles/scripts on the Model Manager settings page (top-level Options menu pages use `toplevel_page_` as the hook prefix, not `settings_page_`).

= 0.0.6 =
* Log failed AI requests (invalid key, network error, timeout) — uses PHP shutdown function to drain any stack entries not popped by `wp_ai_client_after_generate_result`; failed rows stored with `finish_reason = 'error'` and full elapsed duration.
* Capture error messages for failed requests via `http_api_debug` — supports OpenAI, Hugging Face, and generic JSON error bodies; error detail shown in log list (tooltip on red badge) and detail view.
* Replace `WPAI_PLUGIN_FILE` check with `has_ai_credentials()` — Model Preferences now enables for any configured provider (llama.cpp, OpenAI, etc.), not just when the AI plugin is loaded.
* Simplify JS Model Preferences gate — removed `aiPluginActive` flag; section enable/disable is now driven solely by `hasAnyProvider` (presence of models in the PHP payload).

= 0.0.5 =
* Added AI request logging system — every successful AI generation call is now logged to a custom database table (`{prefix}acai_ai_logs`).
* Logs capture: provider, model, capability, prompt text, response text, token usage (prompt/completion/total/thought), duration (ms), finish reason, and the WordPress user who triggered the request.
* Added **source/caller tracking** — each log entry records where the AI request originated: plugin slug, theme slug, mu-plugin filename, or WordPress core, along with the relative file path and line number.
* Added **Settings > AI Logs** admin page with a sortable, paginated log table (date, capability, provider, model, source, tokens, duration). Includes bulk delete and a detail view showing full prompt and response text.
* Added **Log Retention** setting (days) to the Request Settings card — logs older than the configured number of days are automatically deleted daily via WP-Cron. Default: 30 days.
* Log table is created on plugin activation via `dbDelta()` and dropped cleanly on plugin uninstall.
* Reduced AGENTS.md size by 40% — split into focused reference docs under `docs/` (hooks, classes, JS frontend, decisions).

= 0.0.4 =
* Add Feature to track WP AI Client
* Add Screenshots
* Add Video

= 0.0.3 =
* Added compatibility badges to settings card headers indicating which AI integration each section supports (WP AI Client, AI Plugin, coming soon).
* Model Preferences section is now disabled when the AI plugin is inactive — shows a warning notice with a direct link to the Connectors screen.
* Model Preferences section is also disabled when the AI plugin is active but no AI providers are configured — shows a distinct notice prompting the user to configure a provider via the Connectors screen.
* Added FAQ entry clarifying WP AI Client support status: HTTP Request Timeout works with WP AI Client today; Model Preferences requires the AI plugin and will gain WP AI Client support in a future release.
* Updated requirements section to clarify that the AI plugin is needed only for Model Preferences; the HTTP Request Timeout works with WordPress 7.0 core directly.

= 0.0.2 =
* Updated requirements: now explicitly requires WordPress 7.0+ (built-in AI client) instead of the separate WordPress AI plugin.
* Clarified that at least one AI connector must be configured for models to appear.

= 0.0.1 =
* Initial release.
* Settings page with React UI under Settings > AcrossAI Model Manager.
* Per-capability model preference for text generation, image generation, and vision.
* Integrates with the WordPress AI plugin preference filter hooks.
* REST API support for seamless save without page reload.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 0.0.5 =
Creates a new database table (`{prefix}acai_ai_logs`) on activation. Deactivate and reactivate the plugin after updating, or the upgrade will run automatically on your next admin page load.

= 0.0.2 =
No database changes — update to reflect the correct WordPress 7.0 requirement.

= 0.0.1 =
Initial release — no upgrade steps required.
